summary: [
  "This post should show up with my other blog posts, because `import.meta.glob()` is returning a list of all my posts in order to create my list.",
  "By relying on Astro’s powerful file-based routing and the `import.meta.glob()` feature, I can automatically build my blog index without manually listing each post."
